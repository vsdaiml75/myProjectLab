# 🏠 Linear Regression: Predicting House Prices

## 📌 Project Overview

This project replicates and extends the linear regression model demonstrated in the YouTube tutorial  
["Machine Learning Tutorial for Beginners – Linear Regression Example in Python [Part 1]"]
(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Q4x58h_BA).

The objective is to predict house prices based on the area (in square feet) using a **simple linear regression** approach.

Implemented using Python, the project uses libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and serialization
- Prediction and visualization
